############# RAW data #############

The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (Vizcaino et al., 2016) repository with the following dataset identifiers for cadaver samples (PXD017774), SILAC samples (PXD018193), and degradome samples (PXD018298000). The RAW data for the transcriptome data has been deposited on NCBI GEO with accession number GSE147383. The custom scripts for processing and analysing the data were housed at github.com/hkudclab/human_disc_proteome. An interactive web interface for the data is available at sbms.hku.hk/dclab/human_disc_proteome.
